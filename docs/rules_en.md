Here is a simplified yet precise translation of the rules for **Innovation**.

### **Game Overview**

You are a civilization leader. Your goal is to guide your people through history by building **Innovations** (cards). You win by claiming **Achievements** (Dominations) or by having the most points when time runs out.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Supply Piles:** Sort cards by Age (1–10) into piles. Place the **Domain** cards aside.


2. **Achievements:** Place one card from each Age (1–9) face up in the center. These are the **Periods** available to dominate.


3. **Player Start:**
* Each player draws two **Age 1** cards.


* **Meld** (play) one face-up in front of you. Keep the other in your **Hand**.


* The player with the alphabetically first card starts.




4. **First Turn:** The first player (and second player in a 4-player game) takes only **one** action. Afterward, everyone takes **two** actions per turn.



---

### **How to Play**

On your turn, you must perform **two actions**. You may choose the same action twice.

The 4 available actions are:

#### **1. DRAW (Research)**

Take a card from the supply pile equal to the Age of your **highest active card** on your board.

* 
*Note:* If you have no cards on the board, draw from **Age 1**.


* 
*Empty Pile:* If the required pile is empty, draw from the next available higher Age.



#### **2. MELD (Technological Breakthrough)**

Play a card from your hand onto your board.

* Place it on top of the matching color pile. If you don't have that color, start a new pile.



#### **3. DOGMA (Activate Effects)**

Choose one of your top cards and activate its **Dogma** (text effect). This is the core mechanic.

* 
**Icons determine who is affected.** Count the specific icon symbols on your board (Crowns, Leaves, Factories, etc.) and compare them with opponents.


* **Two types of Dogmas:**
* **Supremacy (I Demand):** Marked by a specific icon. If you have **more** of the required icon than an opponent, you force them to follow the instructions. Effects are resolved clockwise.


* **Cooperative (I Share):** Marked by a shared icon. Any player (including you) who has **at least as many** icons as you *may* share the effect. Affected opponents resolve it first, then you.




* 
**Sharing Bonus:** If at least one opponent shared your Cooperative Dogma, you get a free **Draw** action immediately after finishing the card effects.



#### **4. ACHIEVE (Dominate)**

To win a Period card from the center, you must meet two conditions:

1. You have a top card on your board equal to or higher than the Period's Age.


2. You have a score (Influence) of at least **5 times the Period's Age**.


* 
*Example:* To dominate Age 3, you need a top card of 3+ and 15 points.





* Take the card and place it in your "Dominations" pile. This action does **not** spend your points.

### **Important Terms & Keywords**

* 
**Active Card:** The top card of any color pile on your board.


* **Score (Comptabiliser):** Place a card face-down under your board (left side). These are your Influence points (value = card Age).


* 
**Tuck (Archiver):** Place a card at the very bottom of its color pile.


* 
**Return (Recycler):** Put a card at the bottom of the main supply pile.


* **Splay (Décaler):** Slide a pile of cards (Up, Left, or Right) to reveal the icons on the cards beneath the top one. This boosts your icon count for Dogmas.



---

### **Winning the Game**

The game ends in one of three ways:

1. 
**Domination Victory:** You collect a specific number of Achievements (Periods or Domains).


* **2 Players:** 6 Achievements
* **3 Players:** 5 Achievements
* **4 Players:** 4 Achievements


2. **Influence Victory:** If a player needs to draw a card higher than Age 10 (because Age 10 is empty), the game ends. The player with the most **Influence Points** wins.


3. 
**Dogma Victory:** Some cards (in Ages 8-10) have special text stating "You win the game" if you meet a specific condition.



### **Special Cards: Domains**

There are 5 special **Domain** cards. You can claim these **for free** (without an action) as soon as you meet their specific requirement (e.g., producing 3 of every icon).
